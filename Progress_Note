- Create Wilson's Algorithm.ipynb (started May 16th, 2022)
- Implementing the algorithm based on 3x3 sparse Matrix (Not yet completed)
- Problem: the output should be the coordinate of matrix that already visited and transform into sparse matrix representing network (still not achieved)

May 19th, 2022
- Rename Wilson's Algorithm.ipynnb to Loop-erased RW_draft.ipynb for avoiding confusion
- Need modify some steps in cont_LERW to correctly return the result

May 22th, 2022
- Revisit the idea of spanning tree and study the implementation for other famous algorithms
- Draft the implementation when using Wilson's algorithm
- Try several approaches to get the first step of Wilson's: Fix two random nodes and perform random walk from one to another without loops

May 24th, 2022
- Complete the draft algorithm that achieves generating the spanning tree from undirected connected graph (unweighted)
- Consolidate all steps into a function "sample_spanning_tree" and validate the script
- (Next plan) consider the weighted graph and minimum spanning tree

May 26th, 2022
- Issue: find out how to generate the new path after obtaining the initial path
- The script is too complex. Need to revisit and, probably, reconstruct
