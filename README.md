# UW-Madison Research Project summer 2022

## Grimmet's Probability on Random Graphs and sampling from USVT
### Research supervisor: Professor Keith D. Levin (Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin--Madison)

### Project Overview
This research project works on the random graphs and sample spanning trees based on Wilson's algorithm. This includes Python programming to perform each analysis. The methodologies consist of (as of Oct-12-2022):
- Generate random spanning trees from Wilson's algorithm (Loop-erased Random walk) with output diagnostic
- Perform an analysis on degrees from spanning tree
- Investigate the maximum degree distribution based on each number of vertices to study its growth rate compare to several benchmark function (log, loglog)
