 Graph Theory
 - path of G is defined as sequence of v0, e0, v1, e1, ..., en-1, vn
 - e_i = <v_i , v_{i+1}>
 - length = n (in this case)
 - Circuits path : v0, e0, ..., en-1, vn, en, v0
 - Circuits path : v0, e0, ..., en-1, vn where en = <vn , v0>
 - Unique components = connected graph
 - No cycle = Forest & Tree if it's connected
 - Subgraph H is a spanning tree of G if V = W and H is a tree
 - delta(u,v) = Summation of |u_i - v_i| from i=1 to d (dimension of vector v)
 
 Uniform Spanning Tree
 - UST measure has a property of negative association
 - Wilson's algorithm uses loop-erased random walk (LERW) to construct a UST
 - Uniform spanning tree (T) is selected from capital T uniformly
   -- P(T = t) = 1/|cap T| ; t \in cap T

Wilson's algorithm high-level idea
- Pick x0 and x1 and perform LERW to get set_path
- Given the path, pick another x (x2) and perform LERW, until it connects to the set_path
- Repeat until the verices are all in the tree
